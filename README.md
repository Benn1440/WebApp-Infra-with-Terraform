This is a comprehensive guide to implementing a multi-environment web application infrastructure with Auto-Scaling on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

# GCP Architecture & Service Mapping
Would be using GCP's managed services:

# GCP Equivalent	Description

| VPC | Subnets	VPC  Subnets are the foundational network. |
| :------ | :----------: |
| Internet Gateway | Cloud Router & Cloud NAT |  Manages egress and ingress for subnets. |
| NAT Gateway | Cloud NAT	allows private instances to access the internet. |
| Application Load Balancer (ALB) | 	HTTP(S) Load Balancer or Internal Application Load Balancer	Distributes traffic to instances. | 
| EC2 Instances	Compute Engine (GCE) | The virtual machines that run your application. |
| Auto Scaling Group (ASG)	Instance Group Manager (MIG) | Manages a group of identical VMs and handles auto-scaling. |
| Launch Template	Instance Template | Defines the configuration for new VMs (machine type, image, startup script). |
| Cloud SQL for MySQL | The fully managed relational database service. |
| Security Groups/Firewall Rules | For controlling traffic to/from resources. |
| CloudWatch	Cloud Monitoring | For monitoring metrics and creating alerts. |
| SNS	Cloud Pub/Sub | For sending alert notifications. |
